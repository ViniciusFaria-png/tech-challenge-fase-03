## üìù Coding Standards

### TypeScript Guidelines
- Use TypeScript for all new files
- Define proper interfaces and types
- Avoid `any` type unless absolutely necessary
- Use strict mode settings

```typescript
// Good
interface UserProps {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

// Avoid
const user: any = { ... };
```

### React Component Guidelines
- Use functional components with hooks
- Define prop interfaces
- Use descriptive component names
- Keep components focused and small

```tsx
// Good
interface PostCardProps {
  post: Post;
  onEdit: (post: Post) => void;
  onDelete: (id: string) => void;
}

export function PostCard({ post, onEdit, onDelete }: PostCardProps) {
  // Component logic
}
```

### CSS/Styling Guidelines
- Use Tailwind CSS classes
- Follow mobile-first approach
- Use semantic class names
- Maintain consistent spacing

```tsx
// Good
<div className="flex flex-col space-y-4 p-6 bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">Title</h2>
</div>
```

### File Organization
- Group related files together
- Use descriptive file names
- Follow the established folder structure
- Export components from index files when appropriate
